# 🇯🇵 Japan Travel RAG

This project is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to answer travel-related questions about Japan. It uses a local, quantized language model and a curated set of Japanese food blogs and restaurant review sites to provide relevant, conversational answers—without requiring GPU support.

> ⚠️ **Work in Progress**:  
> The current version focuses primarily on **food and restaurant recommendations** in Japan. It uses a limited set of URLs for data retrieval. Support for additional topics and broader content coverage is planned for future updates. Future updates will also make the answers more concise.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** Combines document retrieval and generative language models for contextual responses.
- **Local Inference:** Uses a quantized LLM (microsoft phi-2) to run efficiently on CPU-only machines.
- **Custom Web Scraper:** Extracts and chunks food-related content from Japanese travel and culinary blogs.
- **Fast Search:** Uses ChromaDB as a vector database for quick document retrieval.
- **Answer Tuning:** Uses prompt engineering to discourage generic, non-informative language and guide the model toward concise, helpful answers.
